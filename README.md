# TongueColorClassificationSystem

This is a system for classifying tongue based on the color. There are four steps in this system which are image acquisition, color correction, image segmentation, and color classification. The color correction provides 5 algorithm to be chosen: PCC, RPCC, PLSR, K-PLSR, and K-PLSRO. The image segmentation is done by using U-Net Architecture. The color classification is done by using euclidean distance.
